# 🌍 V-Conn – Volunteer Connection Platform for NGOs and Clubs

**V-Conn** (short for *Volunteer Connect*) is a platform designed to connect motivated individuals with meaningful volunteer opportunities offered by NGOs and Local Clubs. It helps users discover causes they care about and empowers organizations to find the right people to drive impact.

- Availability
- Geographic location
